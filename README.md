# RogueDungeon
A Third Person Action RPG Roguelite with a focus on randomly generating the dungeon, enemies and implementing an extendable spell system with the use of Scriptable Objects. Built in Unity/C#.


Controls are WASD for movement, mouse to aim, and 1-4 for spells.


I see this game more as a Tech demo than anything else, but hopefully it can still provide a few minutes of fun!
