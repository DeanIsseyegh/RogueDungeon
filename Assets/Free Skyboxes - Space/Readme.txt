Description

"Free Skyboxes - Space" is a collection of five 6-sided skyboxes featuring space environments. Each skybox comes in three sizes for different levels of detail and performance levels:

  * Large (4096 x 4096 per side)
  * Medium (2048 x 2048 per side)
  * Small (1024 x 1024 per side)
	
The skyboxes are organized in folders:

  * One folder for each environment. In each of them you will find
	- the project file, which you need if you want to edit the skybox in Skybox Studio. If you have Skybox Studio imported, simply double-click the project file to open the editor.
	- 3 additional folders, one for each size. Each of those contains
	  # a ready-made 5-sided skybox of the environment in the respective scale
	  # A "Textures"-folder containing the textures for each side of the skybox in the respective scale

Quick Guide

The included Skyboxes are static and can be used in the same manner as any Skybox in Unity. You can either set them as the active Skyboxs in the scene's lighting settings or directly drag and drop them into the scene.
All textures come without compression. To adjust compression and other texture settings, please use the import settings of the included textures.
